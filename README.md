# Title : Sampling Techniques

## **1. Description**
1) We need to first balance the dataset. I have done it using Oversampling technique.
2) We need to now create samples using different techniques. I have used Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Cluster Sampling, K-fold cross validation and Bootstrapped Sampling.
3) On these samples we need to run 5 different models and calculate the accuracy. The models which I have used are Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, LGBM and KNN.

## **2. Output**

## **3. Conclusion**
The best model performed in our case is the LightBGM Model with average accuracy of 99.025%.
